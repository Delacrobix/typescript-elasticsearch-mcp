    "content": "This document explains how to manage indices in Elasticsearch, including lifecycle policies, rollovers, and snapshots. Improper index configuration can lead to shard imbalance and high disk usage. To maintain performance, monitor shard sizes and use ILM to automate index rotation. Snapshots should be stored in a remote repository such as S3 for disaster recovery.",

    "content": "A robust CI/CD pipeline improves code quality and reduces deployment risk. Always include linting, testing, and security scans before merging to main. Use environment variables for secrets and keep build artifacts versioned. Monitor build times to identify bottlenecks, and use parallel jobs to reduce total execution time.",
